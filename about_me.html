  <h1>Know About ME !!!</h1>
  <p>Hi,My name is John Reddy, a second year postgraduate student (MS) at Saint louis University Missouri, USA, studying Bioinformatics and computational biology.
	At present I have been working as a graduate assistant in Dr. Zhenguo Lin lab on Next generation sequencing analysis. 
	<br />
	<br />
	Over the past few months I enjoyed working with NGS data and developing and maintaining pipilens. Mostly, I deal with saccharomyces cerevisiae species. 
	Initially, I am from biotechnology background with no programming experience and during my masters I have had enough experience
	to buid my programming skills. I am willing to explore my opportunities in multiple areas of Bioinformatics especially in machine learning and 
	contribute to interdisplinary research. My research interests include genomics, bioinformatics, biometry, stastistical programming, machine learning, and
	high performance computing. I love to play with NGS tools to understand the underlying mechanisms in high throughput sequencing data.
	I would like to use state-of-the-art computational resourses to analyze massive genomic data.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	My favorite thing outside of work it to play different sports. In my spare time I like to play Squash, badminton and volley ball. You can find me at SLU recreation center outside work hours.
	<br/>
	At present I am looking for full-time employement opportunites in bioinformatics. It you are a recuiter please have a quick glance at my <a href="Resume_JohnPeasari.pdf" target="_blank">Resume, </a>
